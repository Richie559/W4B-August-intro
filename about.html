            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I was born and raise Fresno, California. I'm the youngest out of 11. I'm serious when it comes to intersets that I'm passionate about. In these recent years I've been struggling with moviation.Being stuck at a job for five really took a load on me. I'm a college dropout because I believe I wasn't made for school. I'm always trying to have fun as you can tell from the bottom picture. I'm Thankful for my sister who recommened this program to me.</p>
